          Habyarimana Iddy, born in 1998 in Rusizi, Western Province, Rwanda, is
          a professional artist who lives and works in Rwanda. From a young age,
          Habyarimana dreamed of becoming an architect, but by the age of 15 he
          found himself drawn to the world of fine art. Influenced by his
          teachers and classmates who recognized his talent for Capturing Images
          From Student Books, he chose to pursue art in secondary school,
          eventually enrolling at Ã‰cole d'Art de Nyundo.

          In 2016, Habyarimana put his first brush to canvas, embarking on a
          journey that would solidify his love for portraiture and figurative
          abstraction. His work often focuses on the lives and experiences of
          Black People capturing moments of humanity with a focus on the unique
          aspects of individual faces. He has long been fascinated by how we
          share common physical features yet remain visually distinct from one
          another. This curiosity has driven him to study and portray these
          differences in his artwork.
        </p>
        <p className="text-center font-bold font-vietnam-pro uppercase">
          Primarily working with oil paints and acrylics, Habyarimana's
          portraits lean toward realism. His technique often involves the
          application of both thick and thin layers of paint, which lends depth
          and texture to his works. Through his art, he explores the
          complexities of identity and human connection.
        </p>
        <p className="text-center font-bold font-vietnam-pro uppercase">
          Habyarimana believes that "art is life, and painting is oxygen." To
          him, art is a vital force that brings joy, freedom, and an ongoing
          opportunity to learn. It allows him to connect with people and express
          the deeper meanings behind their visual language, sharing those
          experiences with the world.
